This is an attempt to build a 16-but processor with a Single Bus funtionality.

Funtions which can be used in it:
    
    1. ADD
    2. SUB
    3. AND
    4. OR
    5. XOR
    6. LOAD
    7. STORE

The components coded:
    
    i) ALU
    ii) DECODER
    iii) PC (Pragram Counter)
    iv) IR (Instruction Register)
    v) REGISTERS

Information related to the code is given in **Specification.docx**.

For test runs **program.txt** with **data.txt**.

The code was done using python.
